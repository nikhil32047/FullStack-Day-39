Day 39:
=========

a) Abstract Methods
=========================
An abstract method is a method declared but not implemented in a class.
It must be overridden by child classes.
Defined using the @abstractmethod decorator from the abc module.

Example:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

Key Points:
No method body
Forces child classes to implement logic


b) Abstract Classes
=========================
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract and non-abstract methods.

Example:
class Circle(Shape):
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * 5 * 5

Key Points:
Blueprint for subclasses
Improves design consistency


c) Interfaces (Pythonic Approach)
=======================================
Python doesn’t have a separate interface keyword.
Interfaces are implemented using abstract classes with only abstract methods.

Example:
class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def start(self):
        pass

Key Points:
Enforces method implementation
Supports multiple inheritance


d) Concrete Classes
=========================
A concrete class implements all abstract methods and can be instantiated.

Example:
class Bike(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Bike started")

b = Bike()
b.start()

Key Points:
Complete implementation.
Objects can be created.
